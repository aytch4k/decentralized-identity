Draft the vault specifications

Below is a detailed draft of the Secure Vault Specification for your Sovereign DiD ecosystem. This specification defines the structure, encryption, storage, and access mechanisms for the vault that stores user passwords, keys, PCI data, PHI, and PII. It’s designed to integrate seamlessly with your existing NFT-based DiD system, ensuring compatibility with Web2, Web3, and Web4 use cases while meeting compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS). The spec is extensible, human-readable, and machine-parsable, with a focus on security, portability, and sovereignty.


Sovereign DiD Secure Vault Specification (v1.0)
1. Overview
The Secure Vault is an encrypted, sharded, and decentralized storage container tied to a user’s Sovereign Decentralized Identity (DiD) NFT. It holds sensitive data—passwords, cryptographic keys, Payment Card Industry (PCI) data, Protected Health Information (PHI), and Personally Identifiable Information (PII)—and is designed to:
Be decryptable only by the user via their wallet-derived homomorphic encryption (HE) private key.

Support interoperability with healthcare (e.g., FHIR, HL7, X12), financial, and general-purpose applications.

Enforce data sovereignty through geo-fenced storage.

Enable seamless credential use across Web2, Web3, and Web4 environments.

2. Vault Structure
The vault is represented as a JSON object, encrypted with HE, sharded into Merkle trees, and stored off-chain (e.g., IPFS). The plaintext structure (before encryption) is as follows:

3. Field Descriptions
vaultSpec: Version identifier (e.g., "SovereignDiD-Vault-v1.0").

vaultId: Unique UUID for the vault, generated client-side.

createdAt, updatedAt: ISO 8601 timestamps for vault lifecycle.

region: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (e.g., "EU", "US") for sovereignty.

encryption:
scheme: "HE" (Homomorphic Encryption).

algorithm: Specific HE scheme (e.g., "TFHE", "SEAL").

publicKey: HE public key for encryption.

keyDerivation: How the HE key is derived from the wallet private key (e.g., HKDF with salt and info).

contents: Array of entries, each with:
id: Unique identifier for the entry (e.g., "entry-001").

type: Category ("password", "web3Key", "pci", "phi", "pii").

context: Contextual metadata (e.g., app, standard).

data: The sensitive data (plaintext before encryption).

metadata: Additional info (e.g., creation time, provenance).

4. Encryption & Sharding
Encryption:
Each contents entry’s data field is encrypted with HE using the user’s wallet-derived private key.

HE public key is stored in encryption.publicKey; private key is never exposed.

Key derivation: HEPrivKey = HKDF(walletPrivateKey, salt, "SovereignDiD-Vault-Key").

Sharding:
The encrypted vault is split into shards (e.g., one per contents entry or logical group).

Each shard is hashed into a Merkle tree; roots are stored on-chain in merkleRoots.

Shards are uploaded to geo-fenced IPFS nodes matching the region.

5. Storage
Off-Chain: Encrypted vault is stored on IPFS, pinned to region-specific nodes.

On-Chain: 
vaultCid: IPFS CID of the encrypted vault, stored in the Identity struct.

merkleRoots: Array of Merkle roots for shard verification.

commitment: keccak256(merkleRoots, secret) for integrity.

6. Access Control
Owner Access: Only the user (via their smart wallet) can decrypt the vault using the HE private key.

Verification: zk-SNARKs prove ownership or data validity without revealing contents.

Export: An Export NFT (exportTokenId) authorizes sharing specific entries (e.g., PHI to a hospital), with metadata defining scope and consent.

7. Interoperability
Web2: Passwords map to SSO logins (e.g., OAuth, username/password).

Web3: Keys integrate with dApps (e.g., signing transactions).

Web4: Extensible context supports AI agents (e.g., fetching PHI with consent).

Healthcare: PHI entries align with FHIR, HL7, X12 via context and data.resource.

8. Compliance
GDPR: 
Sovereignty via region and geo-fenced IPFS.

Consent via Export NFT.

Erasure approximated by revoking DiD NFT and vault access.

HIPAA: HE and zk-SNARKs protect PHI; provenance tracks data origin.

PCI DSS: Encrypted PCI data with restricted access.

9. Example Encrypted Vault (Post-HE)
After encryption, the vault might look like this (simplified):
json

{
  "vaultSpec": "SovereignDiD-Vault-v1.0",
  "vaultId": "uuid-1234-5678-9012",
  "createdAt": "2025-02-27T00:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-02-27T00:00:00Z",
  "region": "EU",
  "encryption": {
    "scheme": "HE",
    "algorithm": "TFHE",
    "publicKey": "0xHEPubKey123..."
  },
  "contents": [
    {
      "id": "entry-001",
      "type": "password",
      "context": {"domain": "example.com"},
      "data": {"username": "<HE-encrypted>", "password": "<HE-encrypted>"},
      "metadata": {"created": "2025-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
    },
    {
      "id": "entry-002",
      "type": "web3Key",
      "context": {"walletProvider": "MetaMask"},
      "data": {"privateKey": "<HE-encrypted>", "address": "0x1234..."},
      "metadata": {"created": "2025-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
    }
  ]
}

Integration with Sovereign DiD
DiD NFT Metadata: References the vault via vaultCid:
json

{
  "did": "did:sovereign:0x1234:1",
  "vaultCid": "QmVault123...",
  "region": "EU",
  "merkleRoots": ["0xabc123...", "0xdef456..."]
}

Smart Contract: Stores vaultCid and merkleRoots in the Identity struct.

Frontend: Manages vault creation, encryption, sharding, and IPFS upload.

Tools & Implementation
Encryption: Use TFHE (Rust) or SEAL (C++) for HE; integrate with wallet via Web3.js.

Sharding: Custom library (e.g., SovereignVault.js) to split and Merkle-ize contents.

Storage: IPFS with regional pinning (e.g., Pinata with EU nodes).

Access: Browser extension or mobile app to decrypt and use vault contents.

Benefits
Unified Credential Store: One vault for all sensitive data across paradigms.

Security: HE and sharding ensure privacy; zk-SNARKs add trustless verification.

Compliance: Meets GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS with sovereignty and consent.

Extensibility: Supports new types (e.g., "biometric") for future needs.

Next Steps
Publish Spec: Release as SovereignDiD-Vault-v1.0 (e.g., GitHub).

Prototype: Build a vault manager with sample entries (password, PHI).

Test: Deploy with your existing contract on a testnet.

This spec turns your ecosystem into a full-fledged identity and credential solution. Ready to refine it (e.g., add more types) or start coding?

Can you write a low level design and architecture document for our did sso solution? I need to start reviewing and getting buyin
