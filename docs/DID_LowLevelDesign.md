Below is a Low-Level Design and Architecture Document for your Sovereign Decentralized Identity (DiD) Single Sign-On (SSO) Solution. This document details the components, workflows, data models, and integration points of the system we’ve designed, tailored for review and stakeholder buy-in. It’s structured to be comprehensive yet accessible, balancing technical depth with clarity for both technical and non-technical audiences (e.g., developers, architects, executives). The focus is on the DiD SSO solution, including the Secure Vault extension, NFT-based identity, homomorphic encryption (HE), zk-SNARKs, and compliance features.

Sovereign Decentralized Identity (DiD) Single Sign-On (SSO) Solution
Version: 1.0
Date: February 27, 2025


1. Executive Summary
The Sovereign DiD SSO Solution is a blockchain-based identity management system that provides a secure, portable, and compliant single sign-on experience across Web2, Web3, and Web4 applications. It leverages NFTs for identity ownership, a Secure Vault for storing credentials (passwords, keys, PCI, PHI, PII), and advanced cryptography (HE, zk-SNARKs) for privacy. Designed for enterprise adoption, it ensures data sovereignty, GDPR/HIPAA compliance, and interoperability with healthcare standards (FHIR, HL7, X12). This document outlines the architecture, components, and workflows to facilitate stakeholder review and implementation.
2. Objectives
Unified Identity: Enable users to manage credentials and sensitive data with one DiD, accessible via SSO.

Privacy & Security: Protect data with HE, zk-SNARKs, and sharding, ensuring user control.

Compliance: Meet GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS requirements with data sovereignty and consent mechanisms.

Interoperability: Integrate with legacy (Web2), blockchain (Web3), and future (Web4) ecosystems.

Enterprise Readiness: Simplify adoption for healthcare, finance, and other sectors.

3. System Architecture
3.1 High-Level Overview
The system comprises five core layers:
Client Layer: User-facing applications (e.g., browser extension, mobile app) for vault management and SSO.

Middleware Layer: SSO service and vault manager for authentication and data handling.

Blockchain Layer: Smart contracts on a Layer 1 blockchain for DiD and NFT management.

Storage Layer: Geo-fenced IPFS for encrypted vault storage.

External Integration Layer: Interfaces with Web2 apps, dApps, and healthcare systems.

  "contents": [
    {"type": "password", "data": {"username": "johndoe", "password": "myp@ssw0rd"}},
    {"type": "phi", "data": {"resource": {"resourceType": "Patient", "id": "patient-123"}}}
  ]
}

Sharding: Each contents entry is a shard with a Merkle root.

5.2 NFT Metadata
DiD NFT:

{
  "did": "did:sovereign:0x1234:1",
  "vaultCid": "QmVault123...",
  "region": "EU",
  "merkleRoots": ["0xabc123..."]
}

7. Security & Compliance
7.1 Security Features
Homomorphic Encryption (HE): Vault data encrypted; only user’s wallet key decrypts.

zk-SNARKs: Optional proof of ownership without revealing data.

Sharding: Data split into Merkle trees, reducing exposure.

Multi-Sig: Regional nodes enforce sovereignty.

7.2 Compliance
GDPR: Sovereignty via geo-fenced IPFS; consent via Export NFT.

HIPAA: PHI encrypted and auditable.

PCI DSS: PCI data secured with HE.

8. Technical Specifications
8.1 Tech Stack
Blockchain: EVM-compatible Layer 1 (e.g., your custom chain).

Smart Contract: Solidity 0.8.20, OpenZeppelin ERC-721.

Encryption: TFHE (Rust) or SEAL (C++).

Storage: IPFS with regional pinning.

Frontend: React/React Native, Web3.js.

Middleware: Node.js, serverless.

8.2 Performance Considerations
Gas Costs: ~200k gas for registerIdentity (depends on shard count).

Latency: SSO login ~2-5 seconds (vault fetch + decryption).

Scalability: Sharding and off-chain storage support millions of users.

9. Risks & Mitigations
Risk: IPFS node availability.  
Mitigation: Use redundant pinning services (e.g., Pinata, Filecoin).

Risk: HE decryption latency.  
Mitigation: Optimize client-side decryption; cache decrypted data locally.

Risk: Regulatory changes.  
Mitigation: Extensible metadata and regional node governance.

10. Implementation Plan
Phase 1 (1-2 months): Deploy smart contract on testnet; build vault manager.

Phase 2 (2-3 months): Integrate SSO service with Web2/Web3 apps; test healthcare mappings.

Phase 3 (1-2 months): Pilot with enterprise client (e.g., healthcare provider); refine based on feedback.

11. Stakeholder Benefits
Users: Simplified credential management across platforms.

Enterprises: Compliant, secure identity solution with minimal blockchain expertise needed.

Developers: Clear APIs and standards (SovereignDiD-Vault-v1.0) for integration.

12. Conclusion
The Sovereign DiD SSO Solution offers a groundbreaking approach to identity management, unifying Web2, Web3, and Web4 credentials in a secure, compliant, and portable vault. By leveraging NFTs, HE, and a sovereign data layer, it addresses enterprise needs in healthcare, finance, and beyond. We seek stakeholder buy-in to proceed with prototyping and deployment.
