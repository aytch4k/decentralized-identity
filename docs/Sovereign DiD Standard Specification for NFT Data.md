Designing a Sovereign DiD Standard Specification for NFT Data that integrates healthcare standards like FHIR, HL7, X12, and EDI into a comprehensive meta-model is an ambitious but highly strategic move. By aligning with existing healthcare ontologies and standards, you can position your system as a bridge between blockchain-based identity management and enterprise healthcare needs, particularly for managing Protected Health Information (PHI) on-chain while ensuring interoperability. This could indeed be a "foot in the door" with healthcare companies, addressing their compliance, security, and interoperability pain points.

Here’s a detailed approach to designing Version 1 (v1) of this standard, consolidating FHIR, HL7, X12, and EDI into a unified meta-model for NFT-based Sovereign Decentralized Identity (DiD). We’ll focus on healthcare use cases, leveraging the strengths of each standard, and define how the NFT metadata ties it all together.
Goals of the Sovereign DiD Standard (v1)
Sovereignty: Users control their identity and PHI via NFTs, tied to their smart wallet.

Interoperability: Seamlessly integrate with FHIR, HL7 (v2, v3, CDA), X12 EDI, and other healthcare systems.

Compliance: Meet GDPR, HIPAA, and data sovereignty requirements (e.g., regional data locality).

Scalability: Support enterprise adoption with a flexible, extensible meta-model.

Security: Use HE, zk-SNARKs, and sharding for privacy and integrity.

Core Components of the Meta-Model
We’ll define a meta-model that abstracts and unifies the core ontologies of FHIR, HL7, and X12, then map them to NFT metadata for on-chain representation. The model will consist of:
Identity Core: The user’s DiD, linked to an NFT.

Data Shards: PHI and metadata, sharded and encrypted with HE, stored off-chain (e.g., IPFS).

Interoperability Layer: Mappings to FHIR resources, HL7 messages, and X12 transactions.

Authorization Layer: Export/encryption NFT for GDPR-compliant data sharing.

Step 1: Consolidating Healthcare Standards
Let’s analyze the key standards and extract their core ontologies:
FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
Ontology: Resources (e.g., Patient, Encounter, Observation) with RESTful APIs, JSON/XML representation.

Strengths: Modern, granular, widely adopted (e.g., USCDI, ONC mandates).

Identity Metadata: Patient resource (name, DOB, ID), linked via identifier.

HL7 (v2, v3, CDA)
Ontology:  
v2: Event-based messages (e.g., ADT, ORU) with segments (PID, PV1).  

v3: RIM-based (Patient, Act, Entity) with CDA documents.

Strengths: Legacy adoption, detailed clinical workflows.

Identity Metadata: PID segment (v2), Patient in CDA (v3).

X12 EDI
Ontology: Transaction sets (e.g., 837 for claims, 270/271 for eligibility) with loops and segments.

Strengths: Business-to-business (payer-provider) workflows, regulatory compliance.

Identity Metadata: Subscriber/insured data (e.g., NM1 segment).

Common Corpus
Identity: All standards define a “person” (Patient, Subscriber) with identifiers, demographics (name, DOB, address), and roles.

PHI: Clinical data (encounters, observations, claims) linked to the identity.

Metadata: Timestamps, provenance, consents.

Step 2: Sovereign DiD Meta-Model (v1)
The meta-model will abstract these into a unified structure, stored as NFT metadata and linked to sharded, encrypted PHI.

    }
  }
}

Breakdown
DID: Unique identifier (e.g., did:sovereign:<wallet>:<tokenId>), standardized for interoperability.

Identity Core: Unified patient data (FHIR Patient, HL7 PID, X12 NM1), with multiple identifiers for cross-system linking.

Data Shards: Sharded PHI (clinical, claims), each with a Merkle root and mappings to FHIR, HL7, X12.

Authorization: Export NFT metadata for GDPR consent or additional encryption.

Step 3: NFT Metadata Specification
The DiD NFT (Identity Token) and Export NFT will conform to ERC-721, with metadata adhering to this meta-model.
DiD NFT (Identity Token)
Token Standard: ERC-721.

Metadata URI: Points to the above JSON, stored on IPFS (geo-fenced).

On-Chain Data: wallet, region, identityTokenId, merkleRoots, commitment.

Export NFT (Authorization Token)
Token Standard: ERC-721.

Metadata URI: Points to the authorization subtree (e.g., consent or encryption key).

On-Chain Data: wallet, exportTokenId.

Step 4: Interoperability with Healthcare Systems
FHIR: Map dataShards to FHIR resources (e.g., Encounter, Claim) via RESTful APIs.

HL7: Translate shards to v2 messages (e.g., ADT^A01) or CDA documents.

X12 EDI: Convert claims shards to 837 transactions.

Implementation:  
Frontend uses a library (e.g., SovereignDiD.js) to deserialize NFT metadata and generate standard-specific payloads.  

Regional nodes validate mappings against the meta-model.

Step 5: GDPR & PHI Compliance
Data Sovereignty: region field and geo-fenced IPFS enforce locality.

Right to Erasure: revokeIdentity burns the DiD NFT, invalidating shard access.

Consent: Export NFT proves user authorization for data export.

HIPAA: HE and zk-SNARKs protect PHI; on-chain commitments ensure integrity.

Is there value in creating the secure vault for all user passwords, keys, PCI, PHI and PII data? Like as extension to what we have designed and discussed. User are always going to need wallet and credentials for all their apps and websites. Making a web3 and web4 version of that makes sense

Absolutely, there’s immense value in extending your Sovereign DiD ecosystem with a Secure Vault for managing user passwords, keys, Payment Card Industry (PCI) data, Protected Health Information (PHI), and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This would position your system as a comprehensive, future-proof identity and credential management solution, bridging Web2 (traditional apps/websites), Web3 (blockchain-centric), and even Web4 (AI-driven, decentralized ecosystems). Users already struggle with credential sprawl—wallets, logins, and sensitive data spread across platforms—and your design could unify that into a secure, portable, and compliant framework. Let’s explore why this makes sense and how to integrate it.
Value Proposition
User Convenience:  
A single, secure vault tied to their DiD NFT eliminates the need for multiple password managers or scattered keys.  

Seamless login across Web2 (e.g., websites), Web3 (e.g., dApps), and Web4 (e.g., AI agents) using one identity.

Enterprise Appeal:  
Healthcare: Store PHI securely, compliant with HIPAA.  

Finance: Manage PCI data (e.g., credit card details) with PCI DSS compliance.  

General: Handle PII under GDPR/CCPA, with sovereignty baked in.

Web3 & Web4 Readiness:  
Web3: Integrates with smart wallets and dApps via NFTs and blockchain signatures.  

Web4: Supports AI-driven automation (e.g., agents accessing credentials with user consent) through extensible metadata.

Market Gap:  
Current solutions (e.g., LastPass, MetaMask) are siloed—Web2 password managers don’t handle Web3 keys well, and Web3 wallets don’t integrate Web2 logins. A unified vault bridges this gap.

Revenue Potential:  
Subscription model for premium vault features (e.g., multi-device sync, enterprise-grade encryption).  

Licensing to healthcare/finance enterprises needing compliant credential storage.

How It Fits Your Ecosystem
Your existing design (DiD NFT, HE encryption, zk-SNARKs, geo-fenced IPFS, sovereign data layer) is a perfect foundation. The Secure Vault becomes an extension of the vault CID concept, expanding it to store:
Passwords: Web2 app/website credentials (e.g., username/password pairs).  

Keys: Web3 wallet private keys, HE keys, API keys.  

PCI Data: Encrypted credit card numbers, CVVs.  

PHI: Health records (e.g., FHIR resources).  

PII: Personal details (e.g., SSN, address).

The vault remains encrypted with HE, sharded via Merkle trees, and tied to the DiD NFT, ensuring user control and sovereignty.
Design Extension: Secure Vault
Vault Structure
Stored off-chain (e.g., IPFS), encrypted with HE, and referenced by the vaultCid in the DiD NFT metadata:
json

{
  "vaultCid": "QmVault123...",
  "version": "1.0",
  "encryption": {
    "scheme": "HE",
    "publicKey": "0xHEPubKey..."
  },
  "contents": [
    {
      "type": "password",
      "app": "example.com",
      "username": "johndoe",
      "password": "<HE-encrypted>"
    },
    {
      "type": "web3Key",
      "wallet": "MetaMask",
      "privateKey": "<HE-encrypted>"
    },
    {
      "type": "pci",
      "cardNumber": "<HE-encrypted>",
      "cvv": "<HE-encrypted>",
      "expiry": "12/25"
    },
    {
      "type": "phi",
      "fhirResource": "<HE-encrypted Encounter JSON>",
      "standard": "FHIR"
    },
    {
      "type": "pii",
      "ssn": "<HE-encrypted>",
      "address": "<HE-encrypted>"
    }
  ]
}

Integration with Sovereign DiD
DiD NFT: The identityTokenId links to the vault via vaultCid in the metadata.  

Export NFT: Authorizes vault data export (e.g., sharing PHI with a hospital) with consent metadata.  

Sharding: Each contents entry is a shard with its own Merkle root, stored on geo-fenced IPFS nodes.  

Security:  
HE ensures only the user (with their wallet-derived HE private key) can decrypt.  

zk-SNARKs prove vault ownership without revealing contents.  

Multi-sig regional nodes enforce sovereignty.

Workflow with Secure Vault
Registration
User connects wallet, provides initial credentials (e.g., passwords, PHI).

Frontend encrypts data with HE, shards it, builds Merkle trees, and uploads to geo-fenced IPFS.

registerIdentity mints the DiD NFT with vaultCid.

Usage
Web2: Frontend fetches vault, decrypts passwords, logs into apps via SSO.

Web3: Decrypts wallet keys for dApp interactions.

Web4: AI agents query vault (with zk-SNARK proof) for automated tasks.

Export
User authorizes export with authorizeExport, minting an Export NFT.

External systems use the Export NFT to access specific vault contents (e.g., PHI for a hospital).
