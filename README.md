# decentralized-identity
This project is a hybrid Decentralized Identity (DID) solution built on **Cosmos SDK** (Layer 1 blockchain) and **Cronos EVM** (smart contract platform). It enables DID creation, Verifiable Credential (VC) issuance, and verification with a one-click launch for a development environment.
